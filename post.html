<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">While there&#x27;s a lot to debate in the article, kudos to Graeber for talking about a taboo.<p>White-collar employees &#x27;work&#x27; (periods of focused concentration) a lot less than 40 hours.  There are exceptions, and HNers may deny this fact (because the demographic is different or because the taboo is more powerful in this circle), but Graeber&#x27;s inebriated cocktail party confessions match my own discussions with friends.<p>However... We&#x27;ve learned a skill, learned the job, and are available for 40 hours.  Western culture really doesn&#x27;t allow us to just show up for the 15-20 hours we really work and get paid the same salary as the 40 we say we do.  So instead of going home early and cooking, working in the garden, bettering themselves, or watching tv, many show up to work and have strange meetings about nothing, conversations at the coffee corner, work unproductively on a tasks that could be done efficiently if they hadn&#x27;t already been at work for 7 hours, or fuck around online while nobody is looking.  It&#x27;s great for eBay and Facebook, not so much for the kids in day care.<p>To some extent, everybody knows this.  Employers are starting to tolerate working from home a lot more, which I think is a tacit acknowledgement of the situation.  I hope that our culture can come to grips with this and acknowledge that most people in creative jobs can&#x27;t really put in a solid 40 hours of truly productive work, while at the same time not condemning them to work as consultants with no savings or pensions.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561484&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561728" href="vote?for=8561728&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561728"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bane">bane</a> 5 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561728">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I was able to spend the last 5 years or so working almost 100% from home (that&#x27;s changed as I&#x27;ve switched jobs recently). I would say I easily did the same amount of work from home as I had in the previous jobs, but I probably really only spent 12-20 hours doing it in any given week.<p>I think the key though is &quot;available for 40 hours&quot; as you say. Even if I was only spending a fraction of the time &quot;working&quot;, the work didn&#x27;t come in a steady state such that I could just hammer it all out in 2 days and screw off the next 3. I might have to spend 30 minutes answering a phone call here, or an email there, or run out to make a site visit to a customer on one day, and then spend that afternoon writing up a report about the visit, whatever.<p>Most of the reason this happened is that, just like with any manufacturing job, you can&#x27;t keep on steady work if your work inputs are delayed, and just like that, white collar jobs also have work inputs and outputs and they get hung up for all kinds of reasons, so you practically can&#x27;t keep up a steady work tempo no matter how much you might want to.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561728&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8562587" href="vote?for=8562587&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8562587"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=cowabunga"><font color="#3c963c">cowabunga</font></a> 2 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8562587">link</a></span></div><br>

Nerd!Rapture).<p>On the other hand, History teaches that every civilization has their decline and fall. I suspect that software in its current incarnation (electromagnetic encoding of behaviors on a semiconductor based machine) is so tied to our current civilization that it will not survive more than 1 or 2 centuries at the most.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&gt; From the outside, it seems like startups do this better than most.<p>As someone on the outside, hearing horror stories about mandatory 14 hour days and regularly working nights and weekends for startups I&#x27;d think they were doing it much worse. It&#x27;s one of the things that has steered me away from working for a recent startup because I refuse to work more than 8 hours a week.<p>I had an interview at a startup where I asked the interviewer to take me through my average day at the company. He basically said I&#x27;d arrive at 8:30 and leave at 6:30 or 7, sometimes later. I told him that to maintain a healthy work&#x2F;life balance I would be leaving at 5pm every day and asked him his opinion on that. He said it would be technically acceptable since they can&#x27;t force you to work more than 8 hours, but would be heavily looked down upon. I didn&#x27;t take the job.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8563272&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8562434" href="vote?for=8562434&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8562434"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=shkkmo">shkkmo</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8562434">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">It&#x27;s most definitely possible to put in 40 hours of work. This mainly happens in more labor-intensive jobs. Note that it doesn&#x27;t have to be construction work. Even your primary care physician&#x27;s job might be described as &quot;labor-intensive,&quot; just because they have so many patients to meet with and so much administrative work to do for each one. I&#x27;m sure many (most?) doctors do put in a legitimate 40 hours of work a week.<p>As another example, when I was a college student there were definitely a lot of weeks when I put in a legitimate 40 hours of work. But it was distributed over many activities, from actually sitting in lecture, to attending office hours, taking tests, studying&#x2F;reading, working on homework, and participating in extracurriculars. There was a ton of downtime mixed in, and there certainly were virtually no solid eight hour blocks of nothing but work.<p>I honestly think a major impediment to office workers like programmers getting in a full 40 hours of productive work is just the environment itself. Just remaining stationary in an office for 8-9 hours a day is intrinsically exhausting, not physically but mentally. The worst part is when you have downtime, but still must remain stationary at your desk in the office. It now feels like you&#x27;re working, but you&#x27;re not. Your energy is draining, but you&#x27;re not actually doing anything productive with that spent energy.<p>(To be fair, I also frequently would do homework up to or beyond midnight, or even on the weekends, whereas today I very rarely do work for my employer after I go home, unless an emergency comes up or I just honestly am so interested in a project that I want to. The upside to the 9-5 workday is that it has a well-defined beginning and end. In college, there was never a feeling of being <i>done</i>, except maybe after your final final for that semester.)</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8562496&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8562866" href="vote?for=8562866&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8562866"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wutbrodo">wutbrodo</a> 1 hour ago  | <a href="item?id=8562866">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I used to very strongly feel this way, but recently I&#x27;m definitely been choosing to put in that much time (and I mean actual productive time), despite being at a company&#x2F;team that puts a strong emphasis on work-life balance (there are a lot of parents on my team and they&#x27;re out the door at ~4:45 to pick up kids, etc).  I think it might have something to do with the fact that I happen to be particularly motivated and excited about what I&#x27;m working on right now (more so than basically ever before in my short working life).  As you said, it may not be sustainable, but I&#x27;ve been doing it for about 8 months now.<p>It makes me wonder if the real issue is being able to do 40 hours of (relatively) unstimulating work, vs just 40 hours of work.  I know for sure that I can&#x27;t handle a tedious, brain-dead task for even half an hour without needing a break, and when I&#x27;ve had roles that were somewhat challenging but less interesting in, I killed a decent chunk of my 40 hours reading articles, etc.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8562866&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561679" href="vote?for=8561679&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561679"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=furyg3">furyg3</a> 5 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561679">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000"><i>White-collar employees &#x27;work&#x27; (periods of focused concentration) a lot less than 40 hours</i><p>There&#x27;s definite truth to this, but it&#x27;s also true that, as many hackers have attested, moments of downtime and wandering attention are often where new ideas come from. Sample:<p><i>I suspect a lot of people aren&#x27;t sure what&#x27;s the top idea in their mind at any given time. I&#x27;m often mistaken about it. I tend to think it&#x27;s the idea I&#x27;d want to be the top one, rather than the one that is. But it&#x27;s easy to figure this out: just take a shower. What topic do your thoughts keep returning to? If it&#x27;s not what you want to be thinking about, you may want to change something.</i><p>For me anyway, a surprisingly large amount of time spent staring at walls or out windows may be &quot;work&quot; time.<p>In addition, I&#x27;m a grant writing consultant (see www.seliger.com if you&#x27;re curious), and a lot of a given day consists of pitching new work to callers, or editing, or waiting for someone to edit what I&#x27;ve  written, and so forth.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This relates to a personal pet issue of mine -- schools like to run surveys asking how much time you spend on homework. But, as far as I can see, the question is ill-posed.<p>Take a non-hypothetical example: I&#x27;m given a math assignment, with the problem &quot;prove (something complicated)&quot;. I look over the assignment, think for a few seconds about the problem, think &quot;nah, that won&#x27;t work&quot;, fail to come up with a different approach, and file it away somewhere in favor of surfing the net and watching my roommates play old console RPGs.<p>Days later, a new approach occurs to me and I come back to the assignment. This time I&#x27;m able to prove (something complicated). Writing out the proof takes 20 minutes.<p>How long did I spend on that question? I wasn&#x27;t able to do the work immediately, so &quot;21 minutes&quot; can&#x27;t be right. But I probably didn&#x27;t actually need to spend several days having it in the back of my mind either. Maybe if I&#x27;d been confined in a little room with just me and the assignment I would have had it done in two hours, or five (really frustrating) hours. There&#x27;s just no way to measure how long I spent &quot;working&quot;. My quality of life goes up if I take the approach of &quot;don&#x27;t sit down to work until the solution serendipitously occurs to you&quot;, but, in an analogous situation, my boss might be a lot happier confining me in a room to sit &quot;unproductively&quot; for 5 hours and write (&quot;productively&quot;) for 20 minutes.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561883&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8562314" href="vote?for=8562314&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8562314"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jobu">jobu</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8562314">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">What always surprises me about articles like this, and the discussions they produce, is how so many engineers and builders-of-things discard the evidence of their years of experience and see the world through the eyes of people who&#x27;ve never built a complex system.<p>For instance, a couple of years ago I inherited a convoluted, needlessly ornate and grotesque application that could clearly be rewritten and even extended in one-fifth the LOC it currently occupied.  When I finally got greenlit to perform the surgery the usual thing happened, which is that I realized, after much painful effort, that the system had become grotesque little by little, in much the same way that good people turn bad: by taking steps that seem appropriate at the time to what the situation demands.  My solution, in the end, was somewhat less grotesque than the original, and certainly more capable, and yet it was not the glittering jewel that I had imagined beforehand, and the path to it was littered with bodies.  I assume many people on this site have had a similar experience.<p>So with regard to repugnant systems (giant commerical banks) and jobs (middle management) or jobs and systems that are repugnant due to the types and numbers of people who seem to be filling them (lawyers, politicians) and wrt established habits and customs and traditions -- to all of it I now perceive that these jobs and systems are the survivors of a mighty selection pressure, and the whole creaky affair so vastly outperformed the alternatives that it has taken over the world to the extent that now it seems as if nothing else is possible.<p>Something else is possible, of course; but the costs of these theoretically more benign and humane alternatives are impossible to envision.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000"><i>all share an element of arms-race components to them</i><p>Sometimes arms races (in the figurative sense) can lead to better performance! This week&#x27;s New Yorker has a splendid example of this in James Surowiecki&#x27;s &quot;Better All the Time
How the &#x27;performance revolution&#x27; came to athletics—and beyond&quot; (<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/10/better-time" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;better-time</a>). It&#x27;s not easy to excerpt, but he points out that athletes used to barely train at all and now they do it all the time; musicians are better; elite students are &quot;better&quot; in many respects; manufacturing has improved. As he writes:<p><i>as the sports columnist Mark Montieth wrote after reviewing a host of games from the nineteen-fifties and sixties, “The difference in skills and athleticism between eras is remarkable. Most players, even the stars, couldn’t dribble well with their off-hand.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&gt; Most of the jobs he categorizes as &quot;bullshit&quot; all share an element of arms-race components to them. i.e. if my competitor has really good telemarketers&#x2F;lobbyists&#x2F;corporate lawyers, I&#x27;d better have one too -- _or they&#x27;ll beat me_. How is it that that reflects some sort of keep-the-masses-down 1% malfeasance?<p>The way I understand it, these pointless &#x27;arms-race&#x27; jobs are jobs tend to also produce little to no value to society.  They may produce value for their bosses in the form of making the boss look good to the uber-bosses, or they may provide value to their company as a means of maintaining competitive advantage in the market place.<p>These is less a direct function of the skills of the workers than a function of the roles in which those workers are placed. Some corporate lawyers clearly do provide non &#x27;arms-race&#x27; value, some IT professionals only provide &#x27;arms-race&#x27; value.<p>I don&#x27;t think the existence of these jobs is a direct effort to &quot;keep-the-masses-down&quot;, but it has the effect of mostly wasting worker&#x27;s time in roles where the main value is how they help maintain the wealth of that 1%.<p>Of course, this an all or nothing proposition. Many jobs produce some mix of actual value vs &#x27;arms-race&#x27; value. Separating these is not necessarily straight forward.<p>&gt; Similarly he writes: &quot;What does it say about our society that it seems to generate an extremely limited demand for talented poet-musicians, but an apparently infinite demand for specialists in corporate law?&quot; There are more musicians employed in this country [1] than there are people in biglaw [2]<p>I... don&#x27;t think those statistics show what you want them to show. Does that number of &quot;musicians&quot; only include those for whom it is their only&#x2F;main source of income? I also don&#x27;t see any breakdown in those statistics on lawyers for &quot;area of specialization&quot; but based on where they are employed.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I work at a large bank in the US. We build websites. Internal websites. The company employs maybe 300k people in the US alone. None of the websites gets more than 10 hits a day! There are 5 websites. And we have 40-50 people to support just that! If all these websites disappeared overnight there would be no difference to the bank. And to the society.
The best part: the bank has been rescued by tax payer money. If it went bankrupt -- as it should have -- I would be working productively somewhere else. Unless &quot;somewhere&quot; else is also supported by the tax payer money and artificially cheap credit, FED rates at 0% full economic cycle now.
The solution is more capitalism, not socialism. I.e. let them go bankrupt! This is what capitalism is all about. You take risks. You win, big payout! You loose, you go bankrupt! This is capitalism, not tax funded corporations. That&#x27;s socialism for the rich. But don&#x27;t call that capitalism, please! Interest rates at 0% for 7 years?! Set by whom? Capitalist free markets? Or socialist bureaucrats who know it all better?! Who sets the rates? Mr. Market or Ms. Yellen? Get rid of the FED too. You will see jobs like mine disappearing. And forcing me to do something more productive than slacking off for $120k &#x2F; year curtesy of the tax payer.<p>Capitalism in crisis is all about reallocating work force from unproductive work at looser companies to do something great at productive companies! That&#x27;s what bankruptcies are all about. Yes, my bank should be history long time ago. Its assets should be taken over by a bank that didn&#x27;t make the stupid mistakes. And smart people who avoided those mistakes. This is what the bankruptcy process is about. Then this new CEO that weathered 2008 crisis making his small bank winning party here and taking over assets of bankrupted banks -- would see that nonsense and fire half of the staff. So they can go do something productive! This is how it works in true capitalism. We don&#x27;t have it though because we believe in socialism. So yep, pay for your zombie bank (and my salary!) because the people who you voted into the office, didn&#x27;t let the markets work!</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561702&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8562055" href="vote?for=8562055&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8562055"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jessaustin">jessaustin</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8562055">link</a></span></div><br>

My point is, yes, you can buy democrats and some republicans to vote in favor of more government spending.

If the feeling at the Capitol was that there will be severe punishment for the bailouts, our beloved Senators and Representatives would be too worried to loose their office to vote for that nonsense. Mind you they can sell their services to other industries too and make money in the process without the risk of loosing office (aka &quot;everything&quot;). The voter allowed them to do that. Because voter doesn&#x27;t understand that bankruptcy and crisis are important parts of economic cycle. And are needed! To remove excesses from the system. To relieve workers from BS jobs too! So you can start over after 1-2 years in healthy economy without zombie banks. We didn&#x27;t allow capitalism to work.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&gt; How can the voters exert punishment when who&#x27;s even running for office is determined by the amount of money available for campaigning?<p>There are a few issues I have with this statement, hence I decided to slice your post. I hope it is ok. Here is what I can&#x27;t agree on:
1. From the very sentence above my understanding is that you notice something very important here: is it that in your opinion democracy doesn&#x27;t work? You see this point you make isn&#x27;t about capitalism. It&#x27;s all about Democracy. Your claim here is that (sorry for vulgar interpretation): democracy doesn&#x27;t work because I see elections after elections that voters vote for guys with most money for the campaign. But that&#x27;s issue with democracy. Not capitalism. As long as money exists, rich&amp;poor exist -- democracy won&#x27;t be perfect. I take different view than that on this. I think you need more than just money to kind of &quot;cheat&quot; in democracy. You need stupid populous too. You need dumb people who care just about 6-packs and entitlements. So whoever promises them the most for the vote casted, gets elected. And then that gets funded by cheap credit, forever low interest rates (FED) and public spending. No wonder both parties do the same. This is late stages of democracy though. Not issue with capitalism. Last time I checked capitalism worked fantastic for a country - namely China -- but without the fallacies of democracy.
2. You are not the only one who notices that. US Government noticed that as well. And compared to China, it seems democracy and capitalism aren&#x27;t as effective as authoritarian system and capitalism. It&#x27;s not only China. Look at South-East Asia in general. If you ask, why we have more militarization of police, huge prison population, NSA eavesdropping, etc, etc -- it&#x27;s all about the elites in the US seeing on the example of China that democracy doesn&#x27;t really work. 
3. Another issue with the statement: would you voted for Hitler given he had the most money in elections in 1933 ? Right, democracy isn&#x27;t idiot-proof. That&#x27;s the real problem with it. You can&#x27;t really let 6-pack-joe voting, that&#x27;s idiotic notion. Again, nothing to do with capitalism.<p>&gt;Add to that the fact that no ordinary citizen directly voted for the bailouts, how can you blame this on the voter? The problem is not the voter, but the system.<p>Democratic system that is. Ordinary citizen not knowing how to vote. Poor idiots. Almost like Jews voting for NSDAP. (Sorry, couldn&#x27;t help myself). Your disbelieve in American voters is mind blowing! The distrust in democracy horrifying!<p>EDIT: voted &lt;-&gt; voting ; stop &lt;-&gt; help</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561861&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="200"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8562165" href="vote?for=8562165&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8562165"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dognotdog">dognotdog</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8562165">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I don&#x27;t distrust the American voter in particular, don&#x27;t worry. Maybe you could say the problem is simply entrenchment.<p>Voters don&#x27;t go and seek out candidates with the most money, it&#x27;s the other way around. Somebody with small funds simply can&#x27;t reach as many voters as somebody with a huge war chest.<p>A capitalism where money is the outmost metric doesn&#x27;t work, just like communism with absolute centralization and discounting all ownership doesn&#x27;t work. Sidestepping the need for social responsibility, a very important factor, that people tend to ignore, about free market theory is that it&#x27;s based on the premise that all information is available to you when you make an economic transaction. In that case, the market can be self-regulating. But in reality, this is by a large stretch not the case. Especially in politics.<p>So there you have a democratic system where money is power to to spew your viewpoint to as many people as possible. The voter doesn&#x27;t have to be particularly ignorant for this to work, as this subverts the usual social channels. You always have incomplete information about the world, even without the help of politics. Money is an undeniable influence factor. A free market can only work if both sides to a transaction disclose all relevant information, be it money or politics.<p>My problem with &quot;The System&quot; is that the influence of money (and other hidden factors) is hushed under the table, and thus, in the vein of the previously mentioned free market principles, self-regulation ceases to work, and you have entrenchment.<p>So that is the dichotomy perpetrated by &quot;pure&quot; capitalism with regards to democracy. If you want money to win, there you have it. Those in power rescued the banks, themselves, effectively, to keep their money and their power, at the cost of the people at the lower rungs being disenfranchised. This has nothing to do with socialist principles.<p>Coming back to the beginning, the two-party system is already biased towards entrenchment, effectively barring small upstarts from entering politics. The mechanics of how this comes about are subtle and evolutionary enough that nobody notices it until its too late. The system is already too broken (maybe only almost...) to allow reform from within, eg. by the regular mechanism of voting and elections. There is also a huge amount of technical debt from the before the information age, that needs to be shed, as well as legal debt from at least two centuries of evolutionary lawmaking.<p>TL;DR: reform is needed, but the system is too encubered to let it happen.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8562165&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561855" href="vote?for=8561855&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561855"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=waterlesscloud">waterlesscloud</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561855">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">While I sometimes describe myself as &quot;libertarian&quot;, this is actually closer to one of my core positions.<p>Large organizations become large because somehow, at some point in their past, they discovered how to produce some sort of wealth greatly in excess of what they were spending to produce it. This creates security for the entity. This security means that they are no longer getting feedback from the real world about what is working and not working; long before the feedback reaches the people in the organization it needs to reach, it has been absorbed by the buffers of high wealth and a lot of people. Consequently the entity begins acting without feedback from the real world. As control systems theory would teach us, the system begins slowly-but-inevitably spinning out of control until it finally exceeds its buffers and comes down in one or another form of catastrophe.<p>I&#x27;ve phrased this in &quot;wealth&quot; and &quot;feedback&quot; because it has jack-shit to do with &quot;capitalism&quot; or &quot;socialism&quot; or anything else. It&#x27;s a general problem with things that get too big. (It does so happen to be a special case of this problem that many, many people want to pile <i>everything</i> into one big entity and call it the &quot;government&quot;, but the problem is very widespread beyond just that one case.) <i>Everything</i> needs feedback to stay connected to the real world, and any time that an entity gets too large to respond to feedback, trouble is assured. The bigger the entity, the bigger the trouble. Big governments, big corporations, big <i>anything</i> is dangerous. And it&#x27;s not because of some mystical badness due to largeness, it&#x27;s very specifically their ability to operate without or even despite feedback from the real world. It isn&#x27;t magical thinking to think that&#x27;s trouble... it&#x27;s magical thinking to think that entity could ever operate <i>without</i> feedback. Despite how this may appear to be ideology, I consider this engineering, and rather simple engineering at that.<p>Smaller organizations can still do very bad things. My parents happen to live in a township (a local government entity that stands in for a town&#x2F;city in the rural area they live) that did something very financially stupid and now they&#x27;ve got some disturbingly substantial extra taxes to pay for a few years to pay it off. Smallness didn&#x27;t prevent the township government from doing something stupid. However, the people who did that stupid thing were immediately outsted and will never serve again... <i>that&#x27;s feedback</i>. When&#x27;s the last time you heard that last bit from a big company or government? (Who in the Federal government has ever paid for <i>any</i> of the bad things that you can name in the past 14 years? It&#x27;s not an empty list, but it&#x27;s a <i>short</i> one for such a massive entity and long time.) And there&#x27;s a township full of people now keeping a closer eye on what financial commitments it makes.<p>So, with that foundation, I&#x27;d submit a lot of these bullshit jobs are themselves an expression of the fantastic, astonishing wealth we&#x27;ve generated as a society. We have them because we can <i>afford</i> to have them. And don&#x27;t forget the fact that the people with bullshit jobs are applying their full human intelligence to the task of looking busy, whether they are doing it on purpose or otherwise. When an entity is large and flush with cash, it lacks the motivation to push through the fog of deception and start ensuring that people are actually generating value.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8562100&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8562433" href="vote?for=8562433&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8562433"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jimbokun">jimbokun</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8562433">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Reading this, I was reminded of the &quot;B Ark&quot; from <i>Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide To The Galaxy</i>: (1)<p><i>The B Ark is technically named &quot;Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B&quot;. The Golgafrincham civilization hatched a plan to eliminate its society of its most useless workers, namely its service sector and its paper shufflers. The Golgafrinchans created a legend that their world was about to be destroyed and they needed to build three arks. In Ark A they would put all the high achievers, the scientists, thinkers, artists, and important leaders. In Ark C they would put all the blue-collar workers, the people that build and make things. In Ark B they would put everyone else: hairdressers, TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, and management consultants.<p>The B Ark was constructed, loaded up, and launched first. However, it was automatically set for a collision course with Earth&#x27;s sun, to finally rid Golgafrincham of these twits. And naturally, no A or C ark was ever made.</i><p>The presence of useless B Ark people in company settings has generated a lot of thought, including this person (2) who suggests dealing with them by &quot;hiring another “B” Ark person to have meetings with them. Demand that accurate minutes are kept and that they should meet at least twice day until the problem is resolved&quot; and engaging them in a useless, circular project.<p>1. <a href="http://everything2.com/title/B+Ark" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;everything2.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;B+Ark</a><p>2. <a href="http://infinite-shades.com/2011/02/14/golgafrincham-b-ark-what-to-do-when-you-dont-have-one-handy/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;infinite-shades.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;02&#x2F;14&#x2F;golgafrincham-b-ark-wh...</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561458&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561624" href="vote?for=8561624&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561624"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=gjm11">gjm11</a> 5 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561624">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">That doesn&#x27;t seem entirely true. If most people didn&#x27;t need money to live, they would be less willing to sign up for &quot;bullshit jobs&quot;, meaning employers would have to provide more enticing compensation, potentially resulting in a reduction in people working such meaningless jobs.<p>In other words, the job market is <i>currently</i> supply driven, but that is due to the fact that demand is inelastic -- everyone needs money to live.<p>ETA: There is also an indirect effect through public policy: politicians will not want to pass legislation that <i>reduces</i> the number of jobs, since that would increase unemployment figures, making them look bad.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This is the price of competition.  It takes a lot of extra labor, over doing the stuff, to keep a competitive market going.  There are a large number of items where the advertising and marketing cost exceeds the cost of production, from soft drinks to movies to pharmaceuticals. This is an overhead of capitalism, and it&#x27;s a big one.<p>The financial system has especially bloated overhead. The US used to have a financial system with three big, independent sectors - commercial banks, savings and loan companies, and stock brokers and markets. The Glass-Stegall Act kept them separate. Trouble in one sector didn&#x27;t crash another sector, because the sectors couldn&#x27;t invest in each other. That ended in the 1990s. Trouble soon followed.<p>The whole hedge fund &#x2F; &quot;private equity&quot; industry is a net lose.  &quot;Private equity&quot; is really leveraged buyouts using equity-to-debt conversions to reduce taxes.  It&#x27;s an artifact of tax policy, not a real industry. In many cases, the money ultimately comes from low-cost borrowing by banks from the Federal Reserve.<p>With different tax and regulatory policies, the finance industry would be about as big as it was in the Eisenhower era, far smaller than it is now. This isn&#x27;t a secret, but it&#x27;s not something discussed in public much.<p>On the medical care side, the US spends about as much in public funds on medical care as the European nations with state-paid medical care do.  But that&#x27;s less than half of US medical spending.

Your competitors have marketers, lobbyists and corporate lawyers, so you need them too.   If everybody fired 90% of their marketers, marketing dollars would go 10x as far, and things wouldn&#x27;t change much.<p>Just take a look at marketing.   It&#x27;s an industry that&#x27;s so big it props up newspapers, television, Google and most of the rest the web just as a side effect.   You can argue that&#x27;s a good side effect, but there are plenty of bad side effects like the invasion of privacy, cluttering up urban spaces, breaking up TV shows, et cetera.<p>This is really a case where I believe that governments should heavily tax the externalities.  What would happen if taxes made advertising and other forms of marketing 10x more expensive?<p>Advertising would become much less common, but it would be much more effective due to its rarity, so that would approximately balance out.   A bunch of bullshit jobs would be lost, but the government would have a bunch more money to hire people for non-bullshit jobs like building &amp; staffing schools and hospitals, as well as reducing harmful taxes like income &amp; sales taxes which also increases the number of jobs.<p>Google, the web, TV and newspapers would lose much of their income and would have to accelerate their shift towards alternative business models, but I would argue that isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing.   Reduced taxes would mean there is more money around for consumers to pay for entertainment.<p>Bad side effects like privacy invasion would be reduced.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s not all good, perhaps there are better ways of reducing this arms race.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561586&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561633" href="vote?for=8561633&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561633"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pidg">pidg</a> 5 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561633">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Bullshit jobs don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum, they are consumers of goods and services produced by other industries. For instance, I&#x27;d wager that most of the print industry serves advertising.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000"><i>The answer clearly isn’t economic: it’s moral and political. The ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger (think of what started to happen when this even began to be approximated in the ‘60s). And, on the other hand, the feeling that work is a moral value in itself, and that anyone not willing to submit themselves to some kind of intense work discipline for most of their waking hours deserves nothing, is extraordinarily convenient for them.</i><p>This has always bothered me, even before I was old enough to join the &quot;work force.&quot; I had a hunch back in the day and have subsequently confirmed it early in my career: working less promotes better, clearer thinking, and ultimately a higher volume of results (i.e. when I work less, I end up getting more done).<p>This is incredibly telling of our times:<p><i>Hell is a collection of individuals who are spending the bulk of their time working on a task they don’t like and are not especially good at. Say they were hired because they were excellent cabinet-makers, and then discover they are expected to spend a great deal of their time frying fish. Neither does the task really need to be done – at least, there’s only a very limited number of fish that need to be fried. Yet somehow, they all become so obsessed with resentment at the thought that some of their co-workers might be spending more time making cabinets, and not doing their fair share of the fish-frying responsibilities, that before long there’s endless piles of useless badly cooked fish piling up all over the workshop and it’s all that anyone really does.</i><p>I encounter this more often than I&#x27;d like to admit. Brilliant, talented, positive people finding their core competencies squashed under meaningless political bullshit. I constantly shudder at the idea of what these people might accomplish if they were given the resources and freedom to do what they were actually good at.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading Freedom From the Known by Jiddu Krishnamurti and this one excerpt really speaks to this problem:<p><i>For centuries we have been spoon-fed by our teachers, by our authorities, by our books, our saints. We say, `Tell me all about it - what lies beyond the hills and the mountains and the earth?&#x27; and we are satisfied with their descriptions, which means that we live on words and our life is shallow and empty. We are second-hand people. We have lived on what we have been told, either guided by our inclinations, our tendencies, or compelled to accept by circumstances and environment.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">As always the written word is open for interpretations and that statement is no exception.<p>What I read from that statement, and knowing a bit about the author&#x27;s background and sharing much of the same political ideas myself, is that it&#x27;s in the interest of the ruling class that people do not have much time on their hands to actually start enjoying not working. Unemployment, and retirement for some, would clearly be more managable if friends and family were not working so much. Just to discover a way of life that&#x27;s not centered around working. I also think that a working class with more time on their hands would inevitably become more organised with increased class conciousness as a side-effect.<p>So basically the idea is that less working time may be a &quot;slipperly slope&quot; that goes against the interests of the ruling class both in the short-term and even more so in the long-term.<p>The second statement is, as I understand it, that this is not driven by some organised unit of capitalist but rather by the idea that the higher classes are more aware of what is in their interests that no central organisation is needed.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561867&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561742" href="vote?for=8561742&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561742"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=crdoconnor">crdoconnor</a> 5 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561742">link</a></span></div><br>

Even if the Kittygram founder had a vision of building an innovative object recognition solution and merely used Kittygram as the means to an end, it feels as if there must be a more efficient way to solve these problems.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561673&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561656" href="vote?for=8561656&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561656"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tim333">tim333</a> 5 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561656">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Interesting article but Graeber seems to mix up some different issues:<p>a) We&#x27;re not working 15 hour weeks. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s mostly because people like to do things. Give people enough money to not need to work and they&#x27;ll still want to go build stuff<p>b) His musician mate made loads as a lawyer, not much as a musician in spite of contributing more to society as a musician. That does seem to be a market failing. Gandhi types preaching peace and making a big positive impact can make nothing, patent trolls can make a fortune while screwing society. Not sure how to fix that.<p>c) &quot;The ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger&quot; - not convinced by that one. I think it&#x27;s a failing of the human mind to attribute what are probably emergent market phenomena to plotting human bad guys.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561656&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8562086" href="vote?for=8562086&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8562086"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=lsseckman">lsseckman</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8562086">link</a></span></div><br>

The amount of coordination and planning it would take to secretly pull it off greatly surpasses even the most talented and motivated groups.<p>It&#x27;s interesting you use Gandhi as an example, there is some substantial evidence he had access to a great deal of the world&#x27;s bounty due to his positive impact.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">What he seems to be railing against is hierarchy. It is easy to see what nurses do in a hospital. They walk around and treat the sick. The nurses have managers (or whatever they&#x27;re called). These managers don&#x27;t treat the sick themselves but they help organize the nurses. All the managers at the hospital are organized by the hospital administrator, and so on.<p>The higher up the hierarchy, the less obvious it is what people do. And with hierarchy, there is also more chance of waste and having a bullshit job.<p>But those bullshit jobs can come at almost any level. My first job out of college was at an environmental firm with extensive government contracts. The firm got paid for every hour they logged under my name on maintenance of projects that didn&#x27;t require much maintenance except on paper. So the firm got paid for me showing up and doing nothing.<p>But I can confirm that it was horrible. At first I liked that I could come in at 10 and leave at 3.

My first job while still in school was being a network operator with maybe 5 hrs a week of real work (most of which I automated away or was just grunt labor install&#x2F;cabling jobs) and maybe 5 randomly allocated hours of stark terror handling outages and disasters.  I was instructed to look busy and professional the other 30 hours per week.<p>1) I &quot;apprenticed&quot; under the PBX operator and helped out with MACs and cable pulling and learned how to terminate and test ST fiber connectors.  I had more formal telecom&#x2F;EE training than the PBX op which was a little weird.  I also apprenticed under our IBM customer engineer and he had be do all kinds of crazy stuff, which was kind of cool.  The IT director got a little greedy about my &quot;volunteering&quot; for him, although if I had a better attitude about it I might have ended up working for him.<p>2) IBM manuals laying everywhere, taught myself some BAL from the books although the sysops wouldn&#x27;t give me access.  Also learned all about ATM.  IBM mainframes had this weird crypto subprocessor with great manuals.  IBM manuals, at least professional level pre 1990, were awesome, I&#x27;d suggest checking out bitsavers.org and reading some.<p>3) Taught myself motorola 68HC11 assembly, procomm&#x2F;telix scripting.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Graeber makes no distinction between &quot;useful&quot; as in: a) creator of exchange value to it&#x27;s maker; b) creator of utility to it&#x27;s holder; b) psychologically &quot;meaningful&quot; to the worker. And while the core of the article deals with the latter, by not making this distinction he dangerously suggests the two former.<p>As much I&#x27;d like to believe that managers are stupid, they&#x27;re not crazy to hand out free money. If an employee generated no additional income to it&#x27;s employer, there would be no reason to hire him in the first place. Similarly, if the holder of a good derived no enjoyment from it, it would be of no value at all to him.<p>It&#x27;s hard to believe, for instance, that a &quot;corporate lawyer&#x27;s&quot; work has no social value. The job of lawyers isn&#x27;t even to win legal battles, but to avoid them in the first place. The job of a corporate lawyer is to ensure corporations are compliant with all the paperwork necessary to their operation. For sufficiently large corporations, they&#x27;re a necessary condition for it&#x27;s functioning.<p>For me, the only reason why his argument might seem personally intuitive is because the majority of things in capitalism are of no use at all to any given particular person, even if all of them are &quot;useful&quot; in some way. Paparazzi, dog-washers and all-night pizza deliverymen are useless for all but the people who demand their services. It&#x27;s not hard to see why consumers would have little interest in contract law if they deal so little with it, and when they do, their job of understanding it has already been cushioned by a specialist.<p>I see little point in coffee shops. Nonetheless, people flock to places with well-developed service economies that offer such things (e.g. New York, San Francisco) along with dog-washers. Perhaps because they know they&#x27;ll cater to their bullshit tastes too.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561532&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8562853" href="vote?for=8562853&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8562853"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bstrong">bstrong</a> 1 hour ago  | <a href="item?id=8562853">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Here&#x27;s Graeber&#x27;s answer to this argument. [1]  His answer is phrased indelicately because the question he was answering was also phrased much more indelicately than yours was:<p><i>Well, I keep emphasizing: I’m not here to tell anybody who thinks their job is valuable that they’re deluded. I’m just saying if people secretly believe their job doesn’t need to exist, they’re probably right. The arrogant ones are the ones who think they know better, who believe that there are workers out there so stupid they don’t understand the true meaning of what they do every day, don’t realize it really isn’t necessary, or think that workers who believe they’re in bullshit jobs have such an exaggerated sense of self-importance that they think they should be doing something else and therefore dismiss the importance of their own work as not good enough. I hear a lot of that.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Some corporate lawyers also persuade upper management they&#x27;re going to be in serious trouble if they don&#x27;t drop the unfair terms from their employment contracts, prevent their companies from being taken advantage of by predatory rivals, kill off patent trolls and prevent utterly frivolous lawsuits from ever seeing the light of day.<p>Poet-musicians seldom play for such high stakes, though ones that can&#x27;t sell enough albums to pay the recording costs or get enough live gigs to feed themselves haven&#x27;t necessarily left their audiences feeling happier on aggregate.<p>It&#x27;s really easy to believe that certain corporate lawyer jobs have no social value, or negative social value. It&#x27;s also really easy to believe that somebody who <i>enjoyed</i> being a &quot;poet-musician&quot; is rather bitter about the fact they now spend sixty suited hours a week wearing a suit composing boilerplate prose, and their whining about what a massive waste of time their job is isn&#x27;t a particularly good illustration of misallocated resources. It&#x27;s natural to believe that stuff you enjoy doing is more socially valuable than stuff you don&#x27;t, but personal feelings of validation are an even worse proxy for social value than the market system.<p>In particular I&#x27;m unconvinced by the link drawn between &quot;talented poet-musicians&quot; failing to get their recording contracts renewed and maldistribution of incomes, as if the 99% were unable to afford to patronise poet-musicians rather than seeing no value in doing so. And funnily enough, if the poet musician suffered from being undiscovered rather than untalented, they could probably benefit from the endeavours of people involved in the drudgery of service sector &quot;bullshit&quot; jobs like A&amp;R man, ad exec, or analyst for music retail platform.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8563453&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8562551" href="vote?for=8562551&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8562551"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=parasubvert">parasubvert</a> 2 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8562551">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The simple social rule that explains this is pecking order. One of the most basic human desires is dominance over others. When you have the money, you hire as many submissive minions as you can. &quot;Bullshit jobs&quot; are just an entourage. Then you display dominance over them by making them do meaningless work - the more humiliating the better.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">His point is that there is no way to provide statistics on the number of bullshit jobs.<p>For example, I worked at a company where we made networking software for some military radios. We had a &quot;Hardware Engineer&quot; that fixed or returned radios that had stopped working. From all economist metrics this was not a bullshit job. He was using his engineering degree to do engineering work.<p>But in reality he added nothing to the productivity of the company.  He actually reduced the productivity of the company by taking 3 days to do 5 minutes of work. I stopped using him and did it myself when he was at lunch.  It is impossible to get metrics on bullshit level because it includes lots of nuances.  For example, i&#x27;m sure this guy and his manager would say that only he was capable of doing the hardware work because he took a 1 hour course on electrostatic discharge.<p>It would take a lot of evidence gathering for me to prove that this was a bullshit job and once I did prove it his manager would have immediately assigned him some new responsibilities making my previous data worthless.  This is a big problem with macro-economics.  Economic Job data is limited to Salary,Title,Hour worked.    It doesn&#x27;t tell you much more than that.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561565&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561463" href="vote?for=8561463&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561463"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=coldtea">coldtea</a> 6 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561463">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Statistics help in testing and validating an author&#x27;s claims. Eloquent deductive reasoning can easily lead to wrong conclusions, which is why we need to test them with empirical results. This author in particular appears to put a prohibitively large value on physical goods over any kind of service. He dismisses the fundamental transition from an industrial economy to a service economy, simply labeling most of the new jobs as pointless. while his arguments might be convincing for a few jobs such as telemarketing, he appears to forget about the highly increased complexity of a modern economy, which requires people working in corporate law, financial services and the administrative sector. in my opinion those regulations weren&#x27;t just invented because<p><i>The ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger [...]</i><p>but rather because: 1) modern technologies require a more extensive management (with an entire workforce dedicated to maintaining them). 2) because globalization creates a much more complex framework for corporations (different local laws). 3) there are much more financial options available today to both individuals and corporations. a small company from Utah can today raise money from investors in Abu Dhabi and an individual from Europe can invest in Australian mining companies - just to name a few examples. this range of services is unprecedented and requires an accordant workforce.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561543&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561197" href="vote?for=8561197&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561197"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=esquivalience">esquivalience</a> 8 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561197">link</a></span></div><br>

There are a lot of reasons why people or companies pay for things, and those reasons aren&#x27;t necessarily related to the value of the things themselves. Consider:<p>- The effect of advertising (in grocery stores, for example: <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2009/11/10635.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.buffalo.edu&#x2F;news&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2009&#x2F;11&#x2F;10635.html</a>).<p>- Corporate environments where bribery -- or its fancy equivalent, paying for nice dinners and ski trips for customers -- determines sales.<p>- Conflict-of-interest: guy responsible for purchasing works out a big contract between his firm and the vendor his wife owns.<p>- Vendor lock-in.<p>- Fear. This explains pretty well the bidding wars between Google and Facebook -- each of which fears losing an advantage over the other -- over startups whose value can very rarely reasonably amount to N times the value of companies who actually Build Things.<p>Money is at most a loose approximation for value.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">For me, it boils down to two questions:
1) Given, that let&#x27;s say only 20% of the population does real work (doctors, teachers etc..), why should they do their work, if everybody else is enjoying spare-time all the time? And if you propose that they also could work less, therefore we would have more doctor positions to be filled, guess what, people that have valuable jobs are also the ones who really like their job, and are happy with working 40 hours, or even more. It&#x27;s somehow ironic that people won&#x27;t do work, just because they like what they do, they also want to be acknowledged monetary, no matter how much they like their job, which I can understand. Somehow we have a situation, i.e. from a doctor&#x27;s perspective, like: &quot;Yea, I&#x27;ll treat you, but only if you are also getting up at seven every morning and commute to some office and do stuff.&quot;<p>2) I think for biological reasons, people need status more than spare-time. We need some kind of hierarchy to determine who is more entitled to spread their genes. If everybody is unemployed, how do you know who has more status? Money and consequently buying power does simplify this problem very neatly, reducing it to a one-dimensional metric scale, easy to compare and communicate.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561601&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561764" href="vote?for=8561764&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561764"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=shkkmo">shkkmo</a> 5 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561764">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Interesting article and a strong feeling that there is something there that we all know but we don&#x27;t say, declare to ourselves and to the others. So I think there another point to add here: everything manages to stick together not because of an not well explained hate for &#x27;real workers&#x27; (I can see that it exists, but how does it contribute to keep everyone in its place?).<p>On one hand it is the most stupid of all the answers: its&#x27; because of money, the salary that you get paid to do this pointless jobs.<p>And on the other hand it is because of something less clearly perceivable, yet profound and &#x27;democratized&#x27;: a part from the &#x27;real&#x27; jobs mentioned in the article - physical labor jobs, agriculture, health services - almost all the other workers are equated by the secret perception of being paid more instead of the value of their job, the value of their real work effort and contribution. But this perception alone won&#x27;t do the job. It works because it is matched by a counter-perception, almost as unmentionable: if most of the employees feel they manage to get paid more than what they do (not of what they deserve because this implies other personal, political, social, intellectual considerations), most of the employers do feel that are paying their employees less than what they contribute to the wealth of the company or organization, less of what their contribution&#x27;s value is.<p>I believe that this is at the parallel combination of these perceptions is, at least one, of the main reasons why everything keep staying the way it is, why we don&#x27;t work less.<p>What to do?<p>Organize the work differently. Start-ups have the potential to structure a division of labour, responsibilities and remuneration that provides a better sense of empowerment, equal contribution to the common aim of that the organization&#x2F;company has, fair returns from the effort done. It doesn&#x27;t last long thou. As soon as the start-up become institutionalized, e.g. direct control is lost over certain operations and processes, the company&#x2F;organization become bigger, certain part of the work done is captured only with quarterly reports or similar simplification, tales of the work done, the objective achieved, it tend to become as any other existing company, recreating that dual perception that I&#x27;ve mentioned before.<p>Bottom line is (probably): perception for perception, let&#x27;s ask more often and with less fear(?) to our colleagues, to the other people in general how much do they earn? what does really involve their job? It may sound a futile exercise but I believe that by communicating to each other, by spelling it out, we will play around with other possibilities, with alternative organizations and modes of labour.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561412&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561533" href="vote?for=8561533&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561533"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=osehgol"><font color="#3c963c">osehgol</font></a> 6 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561533">link</a></span></div><br>

Any family, friends, neighbors, or others going through a hard time right now, how would you like to help them?

Then due to consolidation and mergers there&#x27;s no work in that field anymore (other than the stereotypical &quot;move to SV&#x2F;NYC&quot;).<p>Another direction to go is my grandma did meaningless low skill BS work in an office shuffling papers as a clerk because she specialized in knitting and had amazing knitting skills, but didn&#x27;t feel like being sentenced to life in a textile sweatshop in Vietnam, or where-ever clothes were being made at that time (Vietnam now, but in the 70s?  Surely not the USA by then?).  For my own example there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d tolerate 140 hour work weeks as a medical doctor although I&#x27;d probably have made a heck of a doctor, and I&#x27;m not living in poverty so forget academics&#x2F;sciences, and I&#x27;m not living urban and working in an open plan office so forget SV.  As a hobby I enjoy woodworking but as a profession the pay is bad and the working conditions are awful, also its not very deep so I&#x27;d get bored with it long before I retire, so ... no.<p>So you have chronological problems or retraining problems, and also people that are a skills match but hate the working environment.  Maybe in a communist society the central committee could force my grandma to be a textile worker or force me to be a medical doctor or work at a startup, but there would be a lot of force involved.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8561607&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="200"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8561945" href="vote?for=8561945&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%36%31%30%38%30"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8561945"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=facepalm">facepalm</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=8561945">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Bullshit jobs are central to how our economy works, and their history goes way back. Most &quot;work projects,&quot; unless they are to build infrastructure, are bullshit jobs. I&#x27;m convinced that a significant proportion of the military activity in the world is one big exercise in very pompous and important-seeming bullshit jobs in the defense sector. Whole sectors of the economy are bullshit.<p>The more I see, especially since 2008, the more I think Keynes was really onto something re: monetary velocity. Our biggest problem is excessive pessimism and a zero-sum mentality, manifesting as various paradoxes of thrift. Without monumental efforts at hand-waving to keep the money flowing, our tendency is to deflate all the way back to the dark ages.<p>Bullshit jobs are a semi-conscious hack to keep this from happening-- to keep people &quot;working&quot; so they get paid so the money flows.<p>The other crazy hack around this problem is inflation, and fiat currency in general.<p>The Austrian types who preach how all this nonsense is a result of these things are precisely wrong. Don&#x27;t blame the hack for the thing it&#x27;s fixing.<p>If we can find a more permanent solution to the problems that we&#x27;re hacking around, maybe we can dispense with the bullshit.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I am reminded of a quote from an economics professor. &quot;Why do big nations have a lot of jobs, no matter how much they are producing? As it turns out, this is a very interesting question&quot;<p>This is the robots-are-coming-for-us fallacy rearing its head again. Once again, the premise is that we only need certain things -- food, shelter, electricity, internet, health care. Once robots make these things, well dang, there won&#x27;t be anything else for the rest of us to do, will there?<p>No, no, a thousand times no. Humans value not only things to keep them alive, but scarcity and novelty. As the basic needs become automated, huge industries will continue to explode devoted to creating scarce and novel things for other humans to collect and consume. Most of these &quot;bullshit jobs&quot; are in this sector.<p>I find these essays always have some kind of value statement, either implied or outright -- &quot;what does it say about our society that it seems to generate an extremely limited demand for talented poet-musicians, but an apparently infinite demand for specialist in corporate law?&quot;<p>It says that if you had a magic wand, we&#x27;d have more poets.
